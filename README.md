This is a dashboard to display insights and predictionns from a machine learning model

# Key Features
## 1.Interactive UI with Streamlit
   User-friendly interface built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
    Sidebar sliders for setting input parameters like Sepal and Petal dimensions.

## 2. Data Exploration
Raw data display with an expandable section to view the Iris dataset.
 Visualization of feature columns (SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm) and target (Species).

## 3. Machine Learning Models
  Multiple models available for prediction:
    Logistic Regression (LR)
    Linear Discriminant Analysis (IDA)
    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    Decision Tree (CART)
    Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
    Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  Automatic model evaluation and selection based on cross-validation accuracy.

## 4. Model Evaluation
  Training and testing split with 80/20 ratio.
  Cross-validation applied to each model for performance comparison.
  Displays model accuracy metrics.

## 5. Real-Time Predictions
   Predicts the species of Iris flowers based on user-defined input features.
   Displays the predicted species in real-time.

## 6. Extensible Design
  Easy to extend with additional models or datasets.
  Modular structure allows for quick updates and customization.
